# TreeDeconstructor
This mod for Factorio adds two new items, Tree Deconstructor and Alien Artifact Deconstructor, that act similar to Deconstruction planner, but only deconstructs trees / alien artifacts. It ignores all other selected entities. The items are available after researching the accompanying technology.
